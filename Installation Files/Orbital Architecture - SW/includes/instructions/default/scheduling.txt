<h1>Presentation of tasks</h1>
<center>

<p>In the top right-hand corner of the screen, the participant has access to a planner, which shows the phases during which each task (symbolised by a capital letter and a timeline) will be active.</p>

<p>This helps participants to manage their effort and resource allocation.</p>
