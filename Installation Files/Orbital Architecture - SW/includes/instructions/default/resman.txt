``<h1>Resource Manager</h1>
<center>
<p>In the resource management task, you have to have to maintain the levels of the two main tanks (A and B) by using a set of back-up tanks and pumps, each of which has a specific flow rating.</p>
<p>Your task is to switch the numbered pumps on and off to bring tanks A and B as close as possible to their normal levels.</p>
<p>Normal levels for the A and B tanks are indicated by the small black rectangle to the left of A tank and right of the B tank.</p>
<p>Pumps can sometimes break down, which is indicated when they turn red.</p>
<p>The flow rates of different pumps is indicated on the right side of the task</p>
